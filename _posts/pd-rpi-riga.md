Last week we held with Latvian artist [Krisjanis Rijnieks](rijnieks.lv) a duo of workshops around creative coding on Raspberry Pi. Kris handled the visual part with his workshop "Building Visual Synthesizers with Raspberry Pi and openFrameworks", I handled the audio part with the workshop "Building Portable Instruments with Raspberry Pi and Pure Data". The webpage for the whole event is still online : [http://www.cc4av.info](http://www.cc4av.info).

The workshops ended with a small audiovisual jam session where all the participants could perform with their Raspberry Pi and showcase their work.

It was a lot of fun, big thanks to all the participants, and I think as organizers we're eager to repeat the experience!
