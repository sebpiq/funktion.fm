Last week we held with Latvian artist [Krisjanis Rijnieks](http://rijnieks.lv) a duo of workshops around creative coding on Raspberry Pi. Kris handled the visual part with his workshop "Building Visual Synthesizers with Raspberry Pi and openFrameworks", I handled the audio part with the workshop "Building Portable Instruments with Raspberry Pi and Pure Data".

The workshops ended with a small audiovisual jam session where all the participants could perform with their Raspberry Pi and showcase their work.

It was a lot of fun, big thanks to all the participants, and thanks also to [Irina Spicaka](http://schprici.skematic.lv/) for organizing the CC4AV event, webpage is still online : [http://www.cc4av.info](http://www.cc4av.info).

Here's some pictures from the workshop and the jam (on flickr [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/irinaspicaka/sets/72157636759327736)).
