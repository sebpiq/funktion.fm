Here's a video summarizing our 2 workshops organized in Helsinki in April with Irina Spicaka and Krisjanis Rijnieks : *Raspberry Pi + Pure Data* and *Raspberry Pi + Open Frameworks*.

Each workshop lasted for 3 days, and we closed the event with an audiovisual jam session at mbar in Helsinki city center.

Here's also [some pictures from the workshop and the jam](https://www.flickr.com/photos/irinaspicaka/sets/72157644805678549/).

And by the way ... all sounds in the video have been produced with a Raspberry Pi!
