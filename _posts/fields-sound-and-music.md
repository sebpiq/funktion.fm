We're excited to annouce that [Fields](/projects) will receive support from [Sound And Music](http://soundandmusic.org), the UK's national agency for new music.

<!--more-->
This support is awarded as part of Sound and Music's "audience development incubator" program. It will allow us to organize a small tour in the UK in the beginning of 2015. We will also be featured in [the Sampler](http://soundandmusic.org/thesampler), and hopefully in other blogs and journals! Thank you SAM.
