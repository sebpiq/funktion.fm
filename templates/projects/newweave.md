**New Weave** is an experimental sound performance where the performers improvise with small audio snippets recorded and sent live by audience members with their smartphones.

Snapping their fingers, speaking, whistling into their phones, the participants expose themselves. The performers on the other hand have to respond instantly to any incoming sound, and are thus in a permanent state of destabilization. Through this open outcome and this double vulnerability, a different type of relationship emerges, based on dialogue and exchange rather than blind hierarchy ; a fragile equilibrium, held together with glitchy rhythms and deep pulsating pads.

New Weave has been kindly supported by The Finnish Arts Council (Taike) and Media Lab Helsinki.
